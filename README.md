# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

This human navel microbiome biodiversity dataset from the project, Belly Button Biodiversity, launched by Hulcr, J. et al (2012) reveals that a small handful of microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), are present in more than 70% of people, while the remaining species are relatively rare. 153 samples from 153 participants are included in this dataset. The goal of this project is to build an interactive dashboard that visualizes the data and allows users to explore the microbial diversity in different individuals' navels.

## Project Description
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is a web-based application that visualizes the microbial diversity found in human navels. The application reads the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which contains information about the microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) present in different participations' navels. The dashboard provides interactive charts and visualizations to explore the dataset, including a horizontal bar chart and a bubble chart. Additionally, the dashboard displays individual metadata, allowing users to view demographic information.

## Technologies Used
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is built using the following technologies:

HTML/CSS: Used for the structure and styling of the web page.
JavaScript: Used for implementing the interactive features and data visualization.
D3.js: A JavaScript library used for data manipulation and creating interactive charts.
Plotly.js: A JavaScript graphing library used for creating the bar chart and bubble chart.
React: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface and managing the application state.
Express.js: A web application framework used for serving the dashboard on a local server.
Dataset
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset contains information about the microbial species found in human navels. The dataset is stored in the samples.json file and is loaded into the dashboard for analysis.

## Future Improvements
Due to time constraint, there are still a lot of this project that can be better, including the layout of the whole website, the very crude chart, and the (aesthetics of) labels.

## Credits
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard project is based on the data provided by the Belly Button Biodiversity Study.
